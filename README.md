# COVID-19-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can automatically detect COVID-19 infections from chest X-ray images. Since chest radiography is a widely available, fast, and cost-effective diagnostic tool, an AI-based system can assist doctors by providing quick screening results and reducing the burden on healthcare professionals.
